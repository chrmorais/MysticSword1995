Mystic Sword
1995 - Levi D. Smith @GaTechGrad

QBasic source code for an RPG that I developed.  Use at your own risk.

Installation instructions and steps for running are at http://levidsmith.com/mystic-sword/#MysticSword1995

MS seems to be the stable version.  I think MS10 was an early version (different title screen), and MS11 was a later version (may be the same as MS).
